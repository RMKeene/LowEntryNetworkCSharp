# LowEntryNetworkCSharp

This project implements the network Byte Reader and Writers to match LowEntry's Unreal Engine plugin code.
Free for all to use.

For my UE4 game I use LowEntry for network traffic via TCP/IP Sockets to the server. The serer is written in C# and
serves out world data files and player stats. It sends and receives LowEntry Byte data via. this library.

If you want to contribute let me know.
